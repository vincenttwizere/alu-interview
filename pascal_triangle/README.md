# Pascal's Triangle Project

## Introduction

Vincent is the main author of the Pascal's Triangle project. This project is an implementation of Pascal's Triangle, a mathematical structure that contains an infinite number of natural numbers arranged in a triangular pattern. Each number in the triangle is obtained by adding the two numbers directly above it. Pascal's Triangle has various applications in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra.

## Project Overview

The Pascal's Triangle project aims to generate and display Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. It includes the following key features:

- Generation of Pascal's Triangle: The project can calculate and generate Pascal's Triangle up to a user-defined number of rows.

- Displaying Pascal's Triangle: The program can display the generated Pascal's Triangle in a visually appealing format, making it easy for users to visualize the triangular pattern.

- Access to Specific Entries: Users can query specific entries within Pascal's Triangle, providing the row and column index.

- Documentation: The project includes comprehensive documentation to guide users on how to use the program effectively and understand the mathematics behind Pascal's Triangle.
